K,

No need to worry.

I’ve already implemented additional client-side protections.
There is a dedicated script, "script.js" validates file paths, blocks traversal
patterns, and ensures only approved resources can be accessed.

The logic is a bit complex, but that’s intentional.
Anyone trying to tamper with the system will be stopped before reaching
anything sensitive.

I can personally guarantee that the interface is secure now.

You have my word.
