Q,

I’ve taken a look at the new web interface you deployed last night.
The functionality seems fine, but I’m concerned about how files are being handled.

Exposing file paths through user-controllable parameters is always risky.
You know how creative outsiders can be when they start poking around.

Please make sure the client-side logic is solid and add some extra
security measures before this goes any further.

We cannot afford careless mistakes this time.
