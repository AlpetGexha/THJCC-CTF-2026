Good to hear.

As long as the safeguards are in place, we should be fine.
Just remember — under no circumstances should sensitive files be exposed.

This includes internal configurations, shared libraries,
and especially the flag file.

If anything like /flag.txt or other critical assets were ever leaked,
the consequences would be severe.

Let’s hope your precautions are as effective as you claim.
