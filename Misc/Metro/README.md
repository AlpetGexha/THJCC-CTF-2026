# Metro

**Point: 244**

I took this photo at a MRT station in a certain city/county in Taiwan. Please identify which station it is and which floor it was taken on.

Flag format: THJCC{Station Code-Floor} (Case insensitive)

Example: If the station code for Taipei Metro's Shuanglian Station is R12, and the floor is the 1st floor (using American English numbering), the flag would be THJCC{R12-1F}

`THJCC{A10-3F}`
